# naviance_admissions_calculator_web
There must be two files in etc/naviance_admissions_calculator_web , config.py with the secret key needed for Flask (see Flask documentation) and email_address.txt with two lines for the contact form emails: the first for from and the second for to.
On my server I just copy a model_files folder since that's all you need for this web app
